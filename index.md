# About

I am a software engineer at a search company in the Bay area. Before working, I studied computer science at a small liberal arts college outside of Boston. This is my website and it is still under construction.

This is basically what I work on:
```c
if VideoIsAppropriate() {
	DisplayAd()
}
```
